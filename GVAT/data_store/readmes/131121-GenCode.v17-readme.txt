GENCODE version 17 corresponds to Ensembl 72 from June 2013 and Vega 52 from May 2013.

The GENCODE project aims to annotate all evidence-based gene features on the human reference sequence with high accuracy by integrating computational approaches (including comparative methods), manual annotation and targeted experimental verification. This goal includes identifying all protein-coding loci with associated alternative variants, non-coding loci which have transcript evidence, and pseudogenes. For a detailed description of the methods and references used, see Harrow et al. (2006).

GENCODE Basic Set selection: The GENCODE Basic Set is intended to provide a simplified subset of the GENCODE transcript annotations that will be useful to the majority of users. The goal was to have a high-quality basic set that also covered all loci. Selection of GENCODE annotations for inclusion in the basic set was determined independently for the coding and non-coding transcripts at each gene locus.

Criteria for selection of coding transcripts (including polymorphic pseudogenes) at a given locus:
All full-length coding transcripts (except problem transcripts or transcripts that are nonsense-mediated decay) was included in the basic set.
If there were no transcripts meeting the above criteria, then the partial coding transcript with the largest CDS was included in the basic set (excluding problem transcripts).
Criteria for selection of non-coding transcripts at a given locus:
All full-length non-coding transcripts (except problem transcripts) with a well characterized biotype (see below) were included in the basic set.
If there were no transcripts meeting the above criteria, then the largest non-coding transcript was included in the basic set (excluding problem transcripts)..
It no transcripts were included by either the above criteria, the longest problem transcript is included.
Non-coding transcript categorization: Non-coding transcripts are categorized using their biotype and the following criteria:

well characterized: antisense, Mt_rRNA, Mt_tRNA, miRNA, rRNA, snRNA, snoRNA
poorly characterized: 3prime_overlapping_ncrna, lincRNA, misc_RNA, non_coding, processed_transcript, sense_intronic, sense_overlapping
Transcription Support Level (TSL): It is important that users understand how to assess transcript annotations that they see in GENCODE. While some transcript models have a high level of support through the full length of their exon structure, there are also transcripts that are poorly supported and that should be considered speculative. The Transcription Support Level (TSL) is a method to highlight the well-supported and poorly-supported transcript models for users. The method relies on the primary data that can support full-length transcript structure: mRNA and EST alignments supplied by UCSC and Ensembl.

The mRNA and EST alignments are compared to the GENCODE transcripts and the transcripts are scored according to how well the alignment matches over its full length. The GENCODE TSL provides a consistent method of evaluating the level of support that a GENCODE transcript annotation is actually expressed in humans. Human transcript sequences from the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (GenBank, ENA, and DDBJ) are used as the evidence for this analysis. Exonerate RNA alignments from Ensembl, BLAT RNA and EST alignments from the UCSC Genome Browser Database are used in the analysis. Erroneous transcripts and libraries identified in lists maintained by the Ensembl, UCSC, HAVANA and RefSeq groups are flagged as suspect. GENCODE annotations for protein-coding and non-protein-coding transcripts are compared with the evidence alignments.

Annotations in the MHC region and other immunological genes are not evaluated, as automatic alignments tend to be very problematic. Methods for evaluating single-exon genes are still being developed and they are not included in the current analysis. Multi-exon GENCODE annotations are evaluated using the criteria that all introns are supported by an evidence alignment and the evidence alignment does not indicate that there are unannotated exons. Small insertions and deletions in evidence alignments are assumed to be due to polymorphisms and not considered as differing from the annotations. All intron boundaries must match exactly. The transcript start and end locations are allowed to differ.

The following categories are assigned to each of the evaluated annotations:

tsl1 - all splice junctions of the transcript are supported by at least one non-suspect mRNA
tsl2 - the best supporting mRNA is flagged as suspect or the support is from multiple ESTs
tsl3 - the only support is from a single EST
tsl4 - the best supporting EST is flagged as suspect
tsl5 - no single transcript supports the model structure
tslNA - the transcript was not analyzed for one of the following reasons:
pseudogene annotation, including transcribed pseudogenes
human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transcript
immunoglobin gene transcript
T-cell receptor transcript
single-exon transcript (will be included in a future version)

"In the past, these tables contained data related to sequence that is known to be in a particular chromosome, but could not be reliably ordered within the current sequence.
Starting with the April 2003 human assembly, these tables also include data for sequence that is not in a finished state, but whose location in the chromosome is known, in addition to the unordered sequence. Because this sequence is not quite finished, it could not be included in the main "finished" ordered and oriented section of the chromosome.
Also, in a very few cases in the April 2003 assembly, the random files contain data related to sequence for alternative haplotypes. This is present primarily in chr6, where we have included two alternative versions of the MHC region in chr6_random. There are a few clones in other chromosomes that also correspond to a different haplotype. Because the primary reference sequence can only display a single haplotype, these alternatives were included in random files. In subsequent assemblies, these regions have been moved into separate files (e.g. chr6_hla_hap1)."
