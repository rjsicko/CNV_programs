This track shows human genome high-confidence gene annotations from the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) project. This project is a collaborative effort to identify a core set of human protein-coding regions that are consistently annotated and of high quality. The long-term goal is to support convergence towards a standard set of gene annotations on the human genome.
