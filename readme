Various programs mostly related to copy number variant (CNV) studies. Things like outputting overlap with various databases/regions/genes etc.
General use of these = edit program_v.config specifying input, output and reference files. save config (do not change config file name). then run the program. programs are hardcoded to check for the specified config.   
Note: these were written before I knew about file format standards. They use custom file formats instead of parsing standard format (i.e. vcf or bed files). If you use the code in your project, it would probably be best to adapt it to use standard file formats.
